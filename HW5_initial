Nice work!  For the added recharge, perhaps be a bit more clear regarding the
direction of flow?  For the last question ... what if you make all of the simplifying
assumptions ... no diffusion or dispersion, fully penetrating well ... will the
concentration in the well be the same as the concentration of the recharge?
