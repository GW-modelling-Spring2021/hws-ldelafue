Excellent answers!

I like your explanation of the low flow downgradient.  See if you can craft
an explanation that involves the entire flow system.  For instance, Why does
the flow increase again downgradient from the well along a line through the
well?

Actually, your answer for the capture zone does what I wanted for #1 ...
you're good :)

I also like your elliptical drawdown explanation.  But, what is the influence of
the constant head boundaries?  Again, be sure to give an integrated answer that
brings together all elements of the system!

Should anything be quantitatively comparable between Figures 1 and 6?
