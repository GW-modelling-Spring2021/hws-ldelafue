Excellent work ... 100%!  Because you are way out in front, I'm going to give
you nitpicking detail comments :)  First, the mounding doesn't necessarily
represent 'a lot of water'.  Remember that this is a confined case ... a large
pressure build up may represent almost no water change in storage!  Can you
try to calculate the relative contributions of water from recharge and from the
boundary for your results?  I like your 'magic concepts' idea :)
